I am a software developer with a passion for problem solving. As long as I can remember, I have asked the question "Why?", and I feel that asking that question makes me a good developer and problem solver. It is not enough that I solve the problem (development or otherwise); rather, I aim to understand why the solution works and to learn from that experience with new information to further my own understanding and to help others.

From the time I realize I have passion of learning and memorize everything very quick; I got in love with computer and tried to learn skill from it that can change my life and I become in love with developing software. I knew itâ€™s going to be hard, but with trust I have to myself that I can solve problems one at time and make my way to success. After developing my first project with JavaScript, I find out that I can taught myself to become Software developer and I accomplish the goal I had.
