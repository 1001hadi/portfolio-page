I am a software developer with a passion for problem solving. As long as I can remember, I have asked the question "Why?", and I feel that asking that question makes me a good developer and problem solver. It is not enough that I solve the problem (development or otherwise); rather, I aim to understand why the solution works and to learn from that experience with new information to further my own understanding and to help others.

My first venture into development/coding came during my senior year of undergrad when I took a Visual Basic course to fulfill a general education requirement. The basics I learned in that class helped me during my journey as a self-taught developer - learning more advanced languages and technologies such as HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Node, and React. As a dedicated life-long learner, each time that I sit down to work on a project or to study, I am excited knowing that I will learn something that I didn't know before:)
